FYI:
    (1) "praw.ini" passes sensitive information into code for authentication purposes with Reddit's API.
    (2) You may combine contents from praw.ini with hidden.py; I decided to keep them seperate because praw is natively designed to handle authentication credentials by accessing "praw.ini".
    (3) Keep this secure and do not publish.
